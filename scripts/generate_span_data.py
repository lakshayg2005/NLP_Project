"""Generate weakly-supervised span-annotation data for the Phase 3 token classifier.

Real annotated dark-pattern corpora are scarce, so training documents are composed from
templates: honest product sentences are mixed with manipulative sentences whose trigger
phrase is annotated. Slots ({n}, {price}, ...) are filled randomly to add lexical variety.
The hand-annotated ``data/span_test.txt`` uses different wording and is the real benchmark.
